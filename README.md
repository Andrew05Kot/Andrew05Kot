### 👀 About me:
- 👨‍💻  In general, I am a Backend engineer. Worked on most projects as a full-stack developer.

- 🧠 I'm smart. I have talent for programming. I have strong research and analytical skills through proficient information gathering and thinking abilities. During several years of commercial development, I understood the business processes of the companies for which I provided services well.

- 🖥️ As my main strengths, I consider the ability to write clean code (not ideal - ideal code does not exist). I also have knowledge of Design Patterns and know how to use them.

- 👷 I like to work on big projects with a lot of code. I like to refactor legacy code, and I also like to learn from the best engineers.
While working, I like to dive deeply into solving a complex problem.

- 👾 One of my main hobbies is programming. Therefore, in my free time, I learn something new. Eg. recently, I have been studying Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Deep Learning and Data Analis.

- 🏋️‍♂️ Hobbies: read books, gym, calisthenics, climb mountains, play the electric guitar
